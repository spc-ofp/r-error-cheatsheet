```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
ce <- read.csv('data/toydata1.csv')
```

This is how we select the mean of the values above 75 in a vector:
```{r}
mean(ce$ALB.mt[ce$ALB.mt > 75])
```

This is how you can filter the rows of a data.frame the traditional way: 
```{r}
head(ce[ce$ALB.mt > 75, ]) # add the filtering vector within the first slot
# before the comma
```

This is how you can filter the  rows of a data.frame with dplyr
```{r}
head(filter(ce, ALB.mt > 75))
filter(ce, Month == 1) # shows the rows where Month is equal to 1
```
