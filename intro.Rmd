# Some basic things in R
# Firstly you will need to set your working directory. This is a place where R will go to look for  to import 
# any data you want and where R will store any files you make like figures and tables. 
setwd("C:/Users/YOURNAME/Documents/R_workshop/workshop_material/exercises/introduction_to_r")
# or
setwd("C:\\Users\\YOURNAME\\Documents\\R_workshop\\workshop_material\\exercises\\introduction_to_r")
# to check that you are in the right directort type in the console 
getwd()

# Storing information 
# To store the number 10 for later use:
x<-10
# or 
y=15
x
y
# These are called objects and you can then use these in calculations 
x+y
# and you can store that too
z<-x+y
# You can make a list of these objects this is called a vector
a<-c(x,y,z)
a
# and calculate things from that list
a*2
# or
a/z

## NB named objects are case sensitive
A
## The names you use cannot contain spaces and cannot be entirely numeric
a space<-10
10<-11
# but
a_with.space<-10
X10<-11
# 
# You can view all your objects using 
ls()
# and you can remove an object 
rm(a)

# You can read in an external data set from a txt file or from excel, but you cant read in a .xls file only a .csv 
# so first convert your file to a .csv then read it into R
# this will import the data as a data frame
catch_effort<-read.csv(file="sample_data.csv", header =TRUE)
catch_effort

# note the first column name has changes to catch.year to remove the space
head(catch_effort)
tail(catch_effort)
catch_effort$catch.year

class(catch_effort)
# r reads data frames by row then column so to see a specific number eg the catch of albacore in 2000
# [] use for data frame referencing 
# () used for functions
catch_effort[1,3] # [row, column]
#or
catch_effort[1,"alb"] 

# To change the column names
colnames(catch_effort)<-c("yy","hook", "ALB", "BET","YFT") 

# To make a new column of data with the catch totals you can use thr row sum function (rowSums)
# you need to assign this to a column in the data frame 
catch_effort$total<-rowSums(catch_effort)

# is this correct? 
1162 + 2959 + 1993 # in 2000
# 6114 but the total is 20650 more than that
# so we need to leave out the first twp columnc
catch_effort$total<-rowSums(catch_effort[c(3:5)]) 

head(catch_effort)

#You can also sum the columns you want
colSums(catch_effort[c(-1:-2)])

# calculate the total cpue
catch_effort$cpue<-catch_effort$total/catch_effort$hook

# How would you calculate the average cpue? 

# save the new data to something you can use again
write.csv(catch_effort,file = "catch_cpue.csv" ) # look at the csv file in excel there are row numbers in the file which can be annoying
# these can be excluded:
write.csv(catch_effort,file = "catch_cpue.csv", row.names = FALSE )
# You can also save the data you have created to an R data file
save(catch_effort, x, y, file = "catch.RData")
# or 
save.image(file = "catch_all_data.RData") # will save all active objects
# these are handy things to have as it means that you can access all you objects withour re-running all the code
# you can load them back into the R environmant using load eg:
load("catch.RData")

# 1 Make all of the series from your first plot lines

# 2 Make the same plot above but make the lines thicker and color the lines as follows:
# albacore - forestgreen
# bigeye - firebrick
# yellowfin - gold2
# add a legend in the top right corner 
?legend

# in the plot and legend


savePlot(filename = "first_plot_ex4", type="png")

# 5 add cpue as a new line on a secondary axis as a line with the data points as filled triangles
# hint you will need to make more space around the plot and create a new plot to overaly your original
# use par(new=TRUE)

# 6 Use the bar plot code above and add in a legend, and a heading "Catch of the three main tuna", 
# and x and y - axis labels

# 7 use the plot call above to make individual plots for bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and your barplot 
# then plot each plot in its own panel with a heading on a single page  

savePlot(filename = "first_plot_ex7", type="png")

# 8 Using the cpue_dat file make a box plot showing the annual cpue of yellowfin tuna by year
