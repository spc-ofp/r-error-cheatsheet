<font face="courier" color="red">Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") :
  cannot open file 'file.txt': No such file or directory</font> 
Explanation: the file 'file.txt' is not in your current working directory. To see where that is, type getwd(). To see what files are currently in it, type list.files(), to change the working directory to a new value, use setwd().
