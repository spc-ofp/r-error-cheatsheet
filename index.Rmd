Hello! 

The tutorials we ran during the workshop are included here, let us know if you have any questions!

You will need the datasets for these to work, find them [here](https://github.com/spc-ofp/r-error-cheatsheet/tree/master/data).

And all the `.Rmd` files used are [here](https://github.com/spc-ofp/r-error-cheatsheet). 

The best way to find help online is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) but there are also countless R bloggers that provide tutorials on a range of topics (find all of the R blogs [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)).
