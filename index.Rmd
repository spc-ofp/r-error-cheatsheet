<font color="red"> Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection In addition: Warning message: In file(file, "rt") : cannot open file 'file.txt': No such file or directory</font><p>

*Explanation:* the file 'file.txt' is not in your current working directory.<p>

```{r eval = FALSE}
# To see the current location of the working directory
getwd()
# To change the location of your working directory
setwd(/my/new/working/directory) # specify path here, e.g. C:/Projects/OFP-data
# To see what files are in your current working directory
list.files() # is file.txt here?
```
